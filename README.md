# Colour_Flipper
A website that changes its colours when different buttons are clicked.

In this project I have utilised HTML for the website structure, CSS for the styling of the website for example adding the colours to the website and JavaScript fro the dynamic aspects of the website. Functionalities such as changing colour after clicking a button have been added using JavaScript.
